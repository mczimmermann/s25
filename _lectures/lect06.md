## Announcments 

- Last of the slower days. Hw01 and Lab01 are due tonight! Labs and homework are always due each week on Tuesday at midnight.

- The homeworks relate to the corresponding chapters and sections of the textbook that are explicitly stated on the lecture slides. 
- Electronic version is not the official version and sometimes crashes.

- The inheritance section of the textbook explains that it allows us to use the methods of a parents class.
- We need to visualize and understand where python will jump in its execution.

- While the fraction class is easy to understand, the example is slightly harder to understand if you do not run through the example yourself. 
- Try using python tutor, it is highly recommended and very efficient. It allows you to walk through the steps one at a time and provides a visual as well. 

- Make sure you have a mental picture of what is going on with the code before you start coding.
- This will provide you with a much better understanding when jumping into the labs.


## iClicker Questions

- Any other attributes?
  - Perm number, distance from campus.

- What does it mean to have standard method? 
  - __str__ standard methods provided to you by python. 

- What would be a potential advantage of providing our own constructor?
  - Student jumping ahead: "It gives us control over how the object is initialized, and if another class inherits from it, the child class can also inherit that initialization."
  - Stanton answered: "More convienet to initialize an object of that class with all of the attributes we have already defined."
  - When we have instructor we are batch creating all of the attruutes we want the object to have.
  - Creates that container that is consisent across all of the objects of that class.

- What does a getter method do?
  - Student answered: "Return the value of whatever it is in charge of getting."
- What input does it need?
  - Sean answered: "none"


## Other Questions

- Will you post practice questions for the midterm?
  - The questions that I have at beginning of slides that we go over in class are the review questions. 


## Coding Example

- What does this method need?
  - Sean answered: "self"

- How do I represent that I am comparing two objects?
  - Stanton answered: "You need the other object as an argument"

- Need to return the result that I am comparing what?
  - Sean answered: "perm number"
 
- What other operators?
  - Addition
  - Comparison
 
- How would you call these functions again?
  - Overwriting

- How do we compare it by the year as well?
  - Replace name.upper with year
- Want it in addition?
  - Sean answered: Use (this == this) and (this == this)
  - Has to be an object of the same class or python will have an attribute error
