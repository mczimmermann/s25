# Lab04: Network Penetration Testing Simulation using Stack-Based Traversal

## Learning Goals
In this lab, you'll practice:

- Utilizing a Stack to simulate network path traversal
- Understanding how traversal algorithms are applied in cybersecurity
- Practice writing [pytests](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to ensure your solution is correct

Note: It is important that you start this lab early so you can utilize our office hours to seek assistance / ask clarifying questions during the week before the deadline if needed!

## From Mazes to Networks: A Cybersecurity Context
In the adversarial context of cybersecurity, teams (or military groups) need to access alternate paths to route traffic to a destination as fast as possible while avoiding certain paths that have been compromised or disabled.

Similarly, penetration testers cybersecurity professionals who are hired by corporations to try to identify weaknesses in the digital defenses that safeguard certain digital assets.
These hackers are paid handsomely to infiltrate the networks of their clients, pointing out security flaws with accompanying recommendations to eliminate the weaknesses.

Both scenarios involve a problem that can be modeled similarly to solving a maze, where:

- Empty spaces (' ') represent accessible network nodes
- Walls ('+') represent inaccessible systems or firewalls
- The goal ('G') represents a high-value target (e.g., a server with sensitive data)

Your task is to implement a "network penetration testing simulator" that determines if there's a path from a starting node to a target system, while documenting the traversal path.

## Representing a Network
We'll represent a network as an `n x m` 2D List, similar to how we would represent a maze:

```
network = [
    ['+','+','+','+','G','+'],
    ['+',' ','+',' ',' ','+'],
    ['+',' ',' ',' ','+','+'],
    ['+',' ','+','+',' ','+'],
    ['+',' ',' ',' ',' ','+'],
    ['+','+','+','+','+','+'] ]
```
In this representation:

- `' '` - An accessible network node
- `'+'` - A firewall or inaccessible system
- `'G'` - The target system we're trying to access

The position `network[x][y]` represents a specific node in our network map.

## Traversing the Network
Your function will need to traverse the network given a starting coordinate.
As you traverse, you'll track the number of "hops" (steps) taken and replace the ' ' elements with the step number.
This simulates documenting the path of the penetration test.
You may traverse the network horizontally and vertically (not diagonally).
You must implement your traversal in following way:

 - When reaching a certain node, you must check and move counterclockwise in the following order: North, then West, then South, then East
 - You will always be given a starting coordinate. This will be the first step taken by the function.
 - You will traverse the network until you reach the target ('G'). Once you reach the target, your algorithm can stop.

Using the example network above with a starting position at `network[4][4]`, after your algorithm finishes, the network will have the following updates containing the number of hops:

```
['+', '+', '+', '+', 'G', '+'],
['+', 8, '+', 11, 12, '+'],
['+', 7, 9, 10, '+', '+'],
['+', 6, '+', '+', 2, '+'],
['+', 5, 4, 3, 1, '+'],
['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']
```

## Utilizing a Stack for Network Traversal
In penetration testing, we often need to systematically explore all possible paths while keeping track of previously visited nodes.
A Stack data structure is perfect for this "backtracking" approach, which is essential when dealing with complex networks.

As you traverse the network, you should:

1. Push visited node coordinates onto the Stack
2. Replace the empty space (' ') with the current hop number
3. Check adjacent nodes in the specified order
4. If no valid moves exist from current position, pop from the Stack and continue from the previous position

If the Stack becomes empty before reaching the target, this means there is no accessible path to the target system - a valuable security insight!

## Instructions
For this lab, you will need to create three files:

1. Stack.py - file containing your class definition of a Python Stack using Python Lists
2. lab04.py - file containing your solution to writing the network_path_exists function (renamed from maze_path_exists)
3. testFile.py - file containing pytest functions testing if your solution works as expected

### lab04.py
This file will contain a single function definition `network_path_exists(network, start_x, start_y)`.
The network parameter will be the 2D List network as described above.
`start_x` and `start_y` are the starting coordinates used when traversing the network.
You may assume that the starting position is valid.
The `network_path_exists` function will utilize a Stack and update the network elements with the number of hops at each traversed position.
It should return `True` if a path exists and the target was reached, and return `False` if no path to the target exists.
### Stack.py
This file will contain a Stack class implementation exactly as the one covered in the book using Python Lists. This should contain a constructor (`__init__`), and the `isEmpty`, `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `size` methods. Your solution must utilize the Stack data structure to manage the traversal through the network.
### testFile.py
This file will contain unit tests using pytest to test if your `network_path_exists` functionality is correct. You should create various network scenarios (with and without solutions) and check if the traversal is correct. Write at least one test where a solution exists (different than the one provided in these instructions), and another test where a solution does not exist.

## Security Relevance
Understanding traversal algorithms is essential in cybersecurity for:

1. Network mapping and vulnerability assessment
2. Tracing attack paths and lateral movement possibilities
3. Identifying isolation or segmentation problems in networks
4. Developing countermeasures to block possible attack paths

By implementing this stack-based traversal algorithm, you're learning a fundamental approach used in security tools that analyze potential attack vectors through networks.

## Submission
Once you're done with writing your class/function definitions and tests, submit your lab04.py, Stack.py and testFile.py files to the Lab04 assignment on Gradescope. There will be various unit tests Gradescope to ensure your code is working correctly based on the specifications given in this lab.
Remove any print statements in your submission as they may interfere with the autograder.

## Step-by-Step Network Traversal Process
To illustrate how our penetration testing algorithm works, let's walk through the following example:
Let's say the starting network map and stack looks like this: (first step already taken)
```
[
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', 'G', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', ' ', ' ', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ', '+', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', '+', ' ', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ',  1 , '+'] <- current node  |4,4| <- node coordinates in stack
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']                  |---|
]
```
For each step, we check the 4 directions (north, west, south, east) one by one to see if there is an accessible node to explore.

```
[
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', 'G', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', ' ', ' ', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ', '+', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', '+',    , '+'] <- north is open |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ',  1 , '+']                  |4,4|
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']                  |---|
]
```
Since the northern node is accessible, we move to that node and update the network map and the stack accordingly:

```
[
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', 'G', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', ' ', ' ', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ', '+', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', '+',  2 , '+'] <- current node  |3,4| <- new position in stack
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ',  1 , '+']                  |4,4|
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']                  |---|
]
```
Now, from node 2, we check the 4 directions (North, West, South, East) one by one to see if there is an accessible node.
```
[
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', 'G', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', ' ', ' ', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ', '+', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', '+',  2 , '+'] <- all blocked   |3,4|
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ',  1 , '+']                  |4,4|
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']                  |---|
]
```
When all 4 directions are blocked (N: firewall, W: firewall, S: already visited, E: firewall), we need to backtrack by popping the stack:

```
[
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', 'G', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', ' ', ' ', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ', '+', '+']                  |   |
    ['+', ' ', '+', '+',  2 , '+']                  |   | <- pop
    ['+', ' ', ' ', ' ',  1 , '+'] <- back to node 1|4,4| <- backtrack position
    ['+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']                  |---|
]
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
When implementing your network penetration testing simulation, watch out for these common issues:

1. Initialization Error: Ensure that the starting coordinates (start_x, start_y) are used only once for initializing the starting position in the network. Incorrectly reusing or modifying these initial coordinates during the traversal can lead to inaccurate path trackingâ€”similar to how misconfiguring your starting point in a security scan can invalidate your entire assessment.
2. Node Marking: Each node you explore must be immediately marked with the current hop number. This marking is crucial to avoid revisiting nodes and creating infinite loopsâ€”just as proper documentation during penetration testing helps avoid redundant work and ensures comprehensive coverage.
3. Stack Management: Properly manage the stack by ensuring that only viable paths are pushed onto it and that backtracking is handled correctly by popping the stack when no moves are possible. Poor stack management resembles inefficient penetration testing workflows where potential paths are either missed or redundantly explored.
